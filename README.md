# Stock-Predictor-Website

The project objective is to create a website that provides fundamental and stock price predictor for companies specified by the user.  

Website done entirely on dash plotly.

The website will be segmented into several categories:
Part 1: See website at www.stocksfornoobs.herokuapp.com
1) Single Ticker Analysis (Company profile, annual & quarter financial dashboards, financial ratios analysis)
2) Screener (Stocks in same industry and similar market cap)
3) Comparison charts for both financial ratios and price action 

Part 2:
For the stock price predictor, we will look at the company's stock price movement for a specified number of years, and deploy specific machine learning algorithms to help predict the upcoming stock prices
1) Time-Series Analysis using simple algo of SMA, exponential-smoothing and more complex algo such as LSTM
2) Provide a valuation grading of several metrics of the company, i.e. Revenue Growth - A; Balance Sheet - B; and label the company into the following categories: GROWTH AND SUSTAINING, GROWTH BUT PLATEAUING, OVER-VALUED, UNDER-VALUED
3) Provide a step by step guide to help user calculate the estimated stock value using the discounted cash flow method
